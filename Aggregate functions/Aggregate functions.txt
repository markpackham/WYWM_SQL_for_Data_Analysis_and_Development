Types of Aggregate Functions

The most commonly used types of aggregate function are:

SUM – calculates the sum of values specified by the expression.
COUNT – counts the number of rows in the specified table.
AVG – calculates the average of the values in the expression.
With the exception of COUNT, aggregate functions will ignore null values. The others will not take nulls into account in the calculation.

If, for example, we wish to find the average of a column with 20 rows of numerical data, of which 5 have null values, the average will be calculated on the 15 other values and will disregard the nulls. 

But if we were to perform a COUNT on those rows, SQL would return ’20’.
